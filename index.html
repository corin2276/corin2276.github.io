You are amazingly skilled but also incredibly helpful and approachable, so your support and guidance has been highly valued over our time working together. You have been an incredible asset to the team, both in terms of the work you do as well as your contribution to the team culture. We will miss you greatly and I wish you all the best for the future. </p>

                        I've really appreciated your expertise and commitment to developing technology innovations 
                        to enhance online courses, your wonderful creative problem-solving skills, 
                        and the way you have provided consistently informed, expert and friendly support to Learning Design teams and 
                        partners across the UK and Australia. Your unique blend of technology and people skills should be very much in demand. 
                        You are going to be seriously missed by all of us! Wishing you all the very best for the future, Joanna.</p>

                        offering 10pm meetings with AUS team). Your passion for HTML and 
                        the work you've completed always amazes me, especially when adding your 
                        own wee touch - like your placeholder Australian accent. Keep being you,

                    <p style="font-weight: normal;">Firstly, a huge thank you Scott for being such a committed and positive UK Learning Design team
                        member over the past 6 years. Many of us have worked with you through the development of IDI
                        since you joined, and have forged a close working relationship with you and the whole of the
                        Technology team.</p>
                        <p>We have really appreciated all that you have contributed, with your excellence in technology and
                            innovative digital development. You have been with us during such an important period, and your
                            enthusiasm and true collaborative spirit have helped us succeed through very challenging times.
                            Scott, you have been a key part of IDI and of OES as a growing global education company. You have
                            shown a real talent for agile and collaborative working, embracing new technologies, immersing
                            yourself in new tasks and working so positively with new teams.
                            I hope that in your next role, you will continue to add to your extensive skills portfolio, and expand
                            the specialist knowledge that you have gained over the past years, and with this, it is without doubt
                            that any digital organisation will be lucky to have you in their team.
                            We have all really enjoyed working with you over the years and we are all very sad to see you go.
                            You have added fun and laughter to the UK team, and given us the confidence to take on new
                            technical challenges we have faced. I am certain that you will now move on to new adventures and
                            you will thrive with these new opportunities.</p>
                        
                        <p>We will look forward to keeping in contact with you and to hearing of the work you are involved
                            with in the future, so please keep in touch. It is just goodbye for now, as I am sure we will see you
                            again.</p>

                    You're an incredibly smart and funny guy with terrible luck at Free Lunch Friday 
                    but in the end you won big! And I know that's the way life is going to turn out 
                    for you - you've got big things ahead. Been an honour working with you and 
                    becoming friends. I'll miss our hilarious chats and banter and having someone 
                    to talk about Star Trek with to get me through the day. Have a Mcchans on me 
                    mate and until we meet again - Live Long and Prosper.</p>

                    <p>Hi Scott, I just want to start by saying how amazing you are 
                        at what you do! You have been a huge part of this company 
                        back from when we were still IDI. You were one of the 
                        first people I met and you were so welcoming. 
                        You have contributed so much to the LD team 
                        as well as the wider OES team and we couldn't have 
                        achieved what we have without you. It has been amazing 
                        to work with you, chat with you and just generally 
                        have someone there who is willing to listen to you no 
                        matter how stupid it is. I will always remember back when 
                        I was in the marketing team and you were in the tech 
                        team coming to you with some wild creative ideas for 
                        he website and you going out of your way to work out a way 
                        we could bring these ideas to life! You will be hugely 
                        missed Scott, and I wish you all the best for what is 
                        to come next. I'm sure it will be something perfect!
                        Courteney x</p>

                    <p>Hi Scott. It's been a pleasure working with you for all these years, back when we both joined at the same time in 2017. 
                        You've always been a great member of the team, both on the work side and with all the chats in the office. 
                        I'm very confident that you'll move onto better things as you are very talented 
                        and have lots of skills that are in demand at the moment. All the best, Ross.</p>
